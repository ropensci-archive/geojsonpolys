`geojsonpolys` provides GeoJSON polygons of political boundaries - GeoJSON you some data.

No dependenciez.

Data from <http://eric.clst.org/tech/usgeojson/>, which were converted from files from the United States
Census Cartographic Boundary Files (<https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-cart-boundary.html>).

Contains data for the US only:

- US polygon
- states polygons
- counties polygons
- congressional polygons

## Installation

CRAN version

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("geojsonpolys")
```

Dev version

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/geojsonpolys")
```

```{r}
library("geojsonpolys")
```

## Get you some geojson

There's two datasets in the package so far. 

One `gsp_counties` is a character vector of GeoJSON for each county in the US. For example:

```{r}
gsp_counties[1]
```

`gsp_counties_df` is a data.frame with the GeoJSON but also with metadata for states and counties, which
can make it easier to pick out the GeoJSON you want. (if you load `tibble` you get a brief data.frame 
output)

```{r}
library(tibble)
gsp_counties_df
```

## do something

Multnomah is a county in Oregon that contains Portland

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(geojsonio)
multnomah <- gsp_counties_df[gsp_counties_df$county == "Multnomah", "geojson"]
geojsonio::map_leaf(multnomah)
```
